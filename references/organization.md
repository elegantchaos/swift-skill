# File And Type Organization

Use this file when shaping Swift source files and type boundaries.

- Prefer one primary type per file.
- Name files after the type (`MyType.swift`).
- Use focused extension files for distinct responsibilities (`MyType+Functionality.swift`).
- For protocol-conformance files, use `MyType+ProtocolName.swift`.
- Use PascalCase file names.

In each Swift file, prefer this order:

1. imports
2. log channels (if any)
3. main type definition
4. helper types/extensions
5. `#Preview` at the bottom for SwiftUI view files

## Type organization

For classes/structs, prefer this order:

1. stored properties
2. initializers
3. computed properties
4. public methods
5. private methods (often in private extensions)

For enums, prefer:

1. cases
2. static constants/factories
3. computed properties

For protocols, prefer:

1. properties
2. methods

## Documentation comments

- Add `///` documentation comments to all declarations (types/members/cases etc), including private ones.
- Don't insert a blank line between the `///` comment and the declaration it is attached to.
- Do insert a blank line between doc+declaration blocks, to visually separate them.
- Explain intent, behavior and intended usage in doc comments, not just the symbol name.
- Document individual parameters or return values if they are not obvious.
- Add inline comments only where intent is not obvious.
- For types that are key to the library or app, add a more comprehensive doc comment.
- Comprehensive comments should explain the purpose and design of the type, and how it interacts with other key types.

## Log Channels

When the `elegantchaos/Logger` package is in the dependencies:

- Define individual log channels for key services or subsystems.
- Name the channel using natural language: `public let commandChannel = Channel("Commands")`
- The name can contain multiple words separated by spaces if appropriate.
- Do not use the `alwaysEnabled:` flag.
- Define named log channels for individual services.
