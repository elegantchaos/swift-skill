# Toolchain And Platform Expectations

Use this file when deciding which Swift language and platform conventions should apply.

- Target the latest Swift for new projects (see https://www.swift.org/install/)
- Target the latest system for Apple-focussed projects (see https://developer.apple.com/platforms/)
- Target Swift 6 language mode for new projects.
- Always prefer Swift 6+ modern idioms when possible.
- Do not assume all targets in a multi-target workspace use identical build settings; verify toolchain and deployment expectations before applying broad migrations.

## Legacy Projects

If an existing project or target is using Swift 5 language mode:

- Migrate to Swift 6 if trivial, otherwise suggest a migration path.
- Implement new code with Swift 6 migration in mind.
- Prefer modern concurrency-safe patterns where practical.
- Consider splitting code into multiple packages to ease migration.
- Default UI-facing types to `@MainActor` when it improves correctness; explicitly justify non-main-actor types.
- Implement changes in a migration-friendly style.

## Xcode MCP

For Xcode projects, if the Xcode MCP is configured, prefer its tools over generic alternatives:

    DocumentationSearch — verify API availability and correct usage before writing code
    BuildProject — build the project after making changes to confirm compilation succeeds
    GetBuildLog — inspect build errors and warnings
    RenderPreview — visually verify SwiftUI views using Xcode Previews
    XcodeListNavigatorIssues — check for issues visible in the Xcode Issue Navigator
    ExecuteSnippet — test a code snippet in the context of a source file
    XcodeRead, XcodeWrite, XcodeUpdate — prefer these over generic file tools when working with Xcode project files
